# Scala Programming

Welcome to my Scala learning repository! This repo documents my exploration of Scala, a powerful multi-paradigm programming language that combines functional and object-oriented programming. Follow along as I dive into various concepts, tutorials, and practical applications.

## Why Scala?

Scala is a general-purpose language designed to be concise, elegant, and scalable. Here’s why I chose to learn Scala:
- **Multi-Paradigm:** Combines object-oriented and functional programming approaches.
- **Runs on JVM:** Full interoperability with Java and its vast ecosystem.
- **Scalable:** Suitable for small scripts to large systems and data pipelines.
- **Conciseness:** Powerful language constructs that reduce boilerplate code.

## Learning Objectives

In this repository, I aim to:
1. **Understand Scala Fundamentals**  
   Explore syntax, keywords, data types, control structures, and basic concepts.
2. **Dive into OOP and Functional Programming**  
   Understand how Scala merges these two paradigms.
3. **Build and Test Simple Applications**  
   Learn to create Scala projects, write test cases, and deploy applications.
4. **Explore Advanced Topics**  
   Look into traits, higher-order functions, type inference, pattern matching, etc.
5. **Work on Data Pipelines**  
   Apply Scala to process and analyze data, creating scalable and efficient data pipelines.

## Topics Covered

Here’s a quick overview of the key topics I plan to cover:

### 1. Basics
- Scala Keywords, Identifiers
- Data Types, Variables
- Pattern Matching
- Command Line Arguments

### 2. Control Flow
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do..while`
- Decision Making: `if`, `else`, `match`
- Type Inference

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Abstract Classes and Traits
- Case Classes

### 4. Functional Programming
- Anonymous Functions (Lambdas)
- Higher-Order Functions
- Currying and Partial Functions
- Closures and Recursion

### 5. Collections
- Lists, Arrays, Maps, Sets
- ListBuffer, ArrayBuffer, Tuples
- Functional methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

### 6. Concurrency
- Multithreading in Scala
- Futures and Promises
- Actors and Akka

### 7. Data Pipelines
- Handling data streams
- Working with JSON, CSV
- Integration with Big Data tools

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Scala-Programming.git
    ```

2. Install Scala (if not already installed):
    - [Scala Installation Guide](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)

3. Compile and run Scala programs:
    ```bash
    scalac filename.scala
    scala filename
    ```
